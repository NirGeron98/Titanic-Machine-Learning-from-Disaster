# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
In this project, we refined the Titanic dataset by removing non-essential features and filling missing values, while also introducing new relevant features to enhance model accuracy. After thorough analysis and testing various models, the SGDClassifier was selected for its superior performance. This robust model leverages key insights and patterns identified from the data, inspired by leading notebooks in the field. Our finalized model promises reliable predictions on survival outcomes.
