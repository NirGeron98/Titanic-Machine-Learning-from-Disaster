# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This GitHub repository hosts the code and documentation for a refined survival prediction model based on the Titanic dataset. We've carefully curated the dataset by removing non-essential features and addressing missing values, adding strategic features to enhance the model's accuracy. After evaluating several models, the SGDClassifier emerged as the most effective, selected for its robust performance in leveraging discovered data patterns. This model is designed to provide reliable predictions on survival outcomes, validated by insights from leading analytical notebooks. Explore the repository for a detailed walkthrough of our analysis, model selection, and final implementation.
